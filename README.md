# neural-networks
A collection of various Neural Networks implemented using PyTorch. [Statistical Methods in AI, IIIT-H Monsoon'24]

These algorithms have been vectorized so that they run faster, and docstrings as well as comments are included.

## Pre-requisites
1. `python`
2. A package manager for `python` such as `pip` or `conda`.
3. A virtual environment such as that created using `virtualenv` is recommended.
4. All the packages mentioned in `requirements.txt`. If using `pip`, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
